# Physical-Activity-Monitoring-Using-IMU-Inertial-Measurement-Unit-and-Heart-Rate-Monitor
The goal of this project is to help develop hardware and/or software which can determine the type of physical activity carried out by an individual and to get actionable insights by using PAMAP2 Physical Activity Monitoring dataset http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/pamap2+physical+activity+monitoring

It contains data of 18 different physical activities (such as walking, cycling, playing soccer etc) performed by 9 subjects wearing 3 inertial measurement units (IMU) and a heart rate monitor. This data is stored in individual text files per subject. Each row in each file represents one reading and contains 54 attributes (including timestamp, activity ID, heart rate and IMU sensory data). Among 18 physical activities only 12 activities are protocol activities and we will be focusing only on this 12 activities and our final aim will be to find a suitable machine learning model to predict which type of physical activity a person is doing among this 12 activities
